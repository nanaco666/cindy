/**
 * BufferedAsrProvider decorates any AsrProvider so audio can be appended while
 * the provider's start()/connect handshake is still in flight.
 *
 * Why this exists: capture and the ASR connection are started concurrently to
 * hide connect latency, but several providers silently drop appendAudio calls
 * until their handshake settles (e.g. a fallback provider whose appendAudio is
 * a no-op until the inner provider is chosen). Every consumer that parallelises
 * capture and connect would otherwise have to hand-roll the same buffering,
 * replay-in-order, and abandon-mid-handshake logic — which is exactly the class
 * of race bugs this wrapper removes:
 *
 * - appendAudio before the handshake settles is buffered locally and replayed
 *   in order once start() resolves, so nothing spoken during connect is lost.
 * - stop() while the handshake is in flight does NOT block on it (a cancel must
 *   stay instant); it discards the buffer and tears the inner provider down as
 *   soon as the handshake settles, so a just-opened socket is not leaked until
 *   the server times it out.
 * - A run abandoned mid-handshake (stop() before start() settled) is never
 *   revived: the settled handshake neither marks the provider ready nor replays
 *   buffered audio into a torn-down run.
 * - flushAudio() waits for the in-flight handshake to settle first, so an early
 *   stop still submits the audio buffered during connect instead of stranding a
 *   short utterance as empty text.
 *
 * The wrapper is restartable: each start() begins a fresh run. A stale
 * continuation from a previous run (an abandoned handshake that settles after
 * the next run already started) is ignored via a run token, and the new run
 * first waits for that handshake to settle and closes its connection before
 * opening its own, so an abandoned socket never outlives the run switch.
