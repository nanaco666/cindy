/**
 * Animate a numeric value smoothly toward `target` using requestAnimationFrame
 * with an ease-out curve, similar to claude code's running token counter.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - On first mount, returns `target` directly (no initial 0 → target jump).
 * - When `target` changes mid-animation, the animation re-anchors from the
 *   currently displayed value (not the previous target), so rapid updates
 *   blend seamlessly without visible reverts.
 * - Returns an integer (rounded) to keep token-count formatting clean.
 * - Cancels the in-flight RAF on unmount or when a new animation starts.
 *
 * @param target   The desired final value.
 * @param duration Animation duration in ms (default 400).
