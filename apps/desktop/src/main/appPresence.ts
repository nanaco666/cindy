/**
 * Keeps the primary desktop app visible in platform-native launch surfaces.
 *
 * Design rule:
 * - Main app presence is an app-level invariant, not a voice-input detail.
 * - Feature windows may be transient/tool-like, but they must never make the
 *   primary app disappear from the Dock/taskbar.
 * - Any code that needs to restore or intentionally change app presence should
 *   go through this module, so platform behavior stays auditable.
 *
 * Platform mapping:
 * - macOS Dock visibility is controlled by the process activation policy.
 * - Windows taskbar visibility is window-level, so we keep the main window out
 *   of skip-taskbar mode while allowing tool overlays to hide themselves.
 *
 * Global voice input uses transient, non-activating overlay windows. Those
 * windows must not leak their tool-window behavior into the whole Electron
 * process: macOS should keep the app as a regular Dock app, while Windows
 * should keep the main window visible in the taskbar.
